    h2 Rational
    p Every time I read a specification, I imagine the world where every browser implements the specification. Soon after, I wake from the dream. I know the real is different. I know there are specifications which some browsers support and other browsers don't support. So I wonder whether the specification I am reading is implemented by browsers or not.
    p Specifications themselves rarely provide information of implemenations (browsers) of them. On the other hand major browser vendors maintain the platform statuses which show roadmaps of their browsers. If the specifications is listed in the platform statuses, it is possible to know how browser vendors think about the specification: the specification is implemented by browsers,  being developed or not intent to support.
    p However platform statuses are not integrated with specifications. Thus it is not guaranteed whether the specification is listed in the platform statuses until you check all of platform statuses.
    p To ease this situation, Platform Status Indicator shows whether a specification you are reading is listed in the browsers' platform statuses (Chrome, Edge, WebKit and Firefox).
