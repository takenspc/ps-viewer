    p Every time I read a specification, I imagine the world where every browser implements the specification. Soon after, I wake from the dream. I know the real is different. There are specifications which some browsers supoort and others don't intent to support.
    p The question is whether a specification I am reading is or will be supported by browsers or not. Specifications themselves rarely provide information of implemenations of them. Thus it is hard for me to know whether specifications are ready to use (implemented by browsers) or need time to mature.
    p To be fair, some specifications provides implementation information. For example, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">WHATWG HTML Standard</a> has small boxes which show Can I use... information.
    div.figure
      img(alt='', src='/images/about/whatwg-html.png')
    p Some other specifications including <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view-1/">CSSOM View</a> have small boxes which notifiy a section is not yet widely implemented.
    div.figure
      img(alt='', src='/images/about/cssom-view.png')
    p However majority of specifications don't provide information of implementations.
    p Today, major browser vendors maintain platform statuses which describe roadmaps of their browsers. However, platform statuses are not integrated with specifications. Thus I need to open 4 web sites (platform statues) in addition to the specification.
    p To ease this situation, Plateostatus provides a dashboard of platform statuses.

  section
    h2 What are Platform Statuses?
    p A browser platform status describe roadmap of its browser. It tells me which specifications are supported, will be supported or removed from the browser.
    p Plateostatus tracks following platform statuses.
    dl
      dt Chromium

        a(href='https://www.chromestatus.com/features') Chrome Platform Status
      dt Edge
