    p Every time I read a specification, I imagine the world where every browser implements the specification. Soon after, I wake from the dream. I know the real is different. I know there are some specifications which some browsers supoort and others don't intent to support.
    p Some specifications provides implementation information. For example, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">WHATWG HTML Standard</a> has small boxes which show Can I use... information.
    div.figure
      img(alt='', src='/images/about/whatwg-html.png')
    p Some other specifications including <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view-1/">CSSOM View</a> have small boxes which notifiy a section is not yet widely implemented.
    div.figure
      img(alt='', src='/images/about/cssom-view.png')
    p However majority of specifications don't provide implementation information.
    p Today, major browser vendors maintain platform statuses which show roadmaps of their browsers. However, platform statuses are not integrated with specifications. Thus I need to open 4 web sites in addition to the specification.
    p To ease this situation, Plateostatus provides a dashboard of platform statuses.
