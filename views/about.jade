    p Every time I read a specification, I imagine the world where every browser implements the specification. Soon after, I wake from the dream. I know the real is different. I know there are some specifications which some browsers supoort and others don't intent to support. However specifications rarely provide information of implemenations of them. Thus it is hard to know whether features of specifications are ready to use or need time to mature.
    p Some specifications provides implementation information. For example, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">WHATWG HTML Standard</a> has small boxes which show Can I use... information.
    div.figure
      img(alt='', src='/images/about/whatwg-html.png')
    p Some other specifications including <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view-1/">CSSOM View</a> have small boxes which notifiy a section is not yet widely implemented.

    p However majority of specifications don't provide information of implementations.
    p Today, major browser vendors maintain platform statuses which show roadmaps of their browsers. However, platform statuses are not integrated with specifications. Thus I need to open 4 web sites in addition to the specification.
    p To ease this situation, Plateostatus provides a dashboard of platform statuses.
